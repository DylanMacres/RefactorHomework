For our challenge this week, our class was tasked with taking pre-made code and making it cleaner and giving it an overall refaction. 

The proccess I personally took was to change my class titles to IDs and to group up similar attributes together to clean the code. Also with that process I took div heading in the index.html file and made it a nav for the navigation bar at the top right.

At the end of my coding process I went back to the css file and added comments for an easier way to read what each section of the css does while making it easier for any additions later.
